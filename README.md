## Takeaways

Flutter is an awesome UI toolkit which includes widgets and animations already built in. While I enjoyed my time learning about Flutter and using it to create my portfolio, I have realized that Flutter is not ready for web (yet!). As of yet, Flutter still does not distinguish trackpad and mouse wheel scroll, and does not support fullscreen mode of mobile browers (where the address and navigation bar collapse on scroll). For now, Flutter is better off to be used for web apps instead of websites. I hope these issues are addressed soon, so that Flutter Web can truly compete with other toolkits.
